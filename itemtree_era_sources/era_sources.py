"""Historical Classic Era source facts, derived from two pinned community databases.

No client build says where an item comes from: drops, vendors, gathering nodes, containers
and quest turn ins are all server side. This stage fills that gap from the **CMaNGOS Classic
content database**, the 1.12 world database the MaNGOS community maintains, and compiles the
result into a single module, `EraSources.lua`. The addon draws it under the Predicted badge
with a "Classic Era" provenance, never as a fact about the client the player is running.

It is the only source this module reads, and it is read whole: one source of truth, one
credit, and nothing blended in from anywhere else. What it gives over the version 1 table it
replaced on 2026-09-20 is every source an item has rather than one, thirteen categories
rather than five, and gathering at all, so Deviate Scale, Medium Hide, Black Lotus and Iron
Ore have a source and Refreshing Spring Water keeps all 184 of its vendors alongside its
quests. The measurement that settled it is the last section of docs/source-data-options.md.

What is taken, and nothing else: the source category, the creature, object, vendor and quest
NAME, the creature and object **id**, the creature's display id, the Blizzard area id, the
quest id and the faction its race mask implies, the drop chance, the level band of a
summarised group, a limited stock vendor's stock count, the container item's own id, and since
2026-09-20 a handful of **map pins** per creature name per area, and since 2026-09-27 per herb,
vein, fishing pool and chest name per area too, and since brief N3 which creature starts and which
ends each quest, by the creature's name, and since brief EK1 the lowest creature and object entry
id of each name (`ci`, `oi`), which the addon keys a page by. No prose of any kind: not the
loot rows' `comments`, not quest text, not gossip, not scripts.

Since 2026-09-27 (brief T1, on the owner's ruling of 2026-09-27) two more columns of
`creature_template` are read, for the vendors and the quest givers and enders the table already
names and no other creature: `SubName`, the short title under a name such as "Cooking Supplies",
which is a title and not prose, shipped in `st` so a vendor row can say where to look; and
`Faction`, a FactionTemplate id, which the caller reduces through a client build's own
`FactionTemplate` and `Faction` tables to one number (1 Alliance, 2 Horde, 3 both) on its own side
(ItemTree's EraPlaces.lua `cf`, never this file), so a recipe whose only vendor is Alliance can say
so. Nothing else about a faction is read.

Since 2026-09-29 (brief W12, on the owner's ruling of 2026-09-29) `quest_template.ReqItemId1..4`,
read before only so a quest only drop could name its quest, ships as well, with the two new
columns beside it, `ReqItemCount1..4`: per kept quest, the items it asks the player to bring and
how many of each, in `qr`, so a quest item's "Used by" can name the quest. Ids and counts only,
never the quest's text; an item this build does not ship is refused as a row for it would be.
A `qr` quest nothing else titles gets its title in `qt`: an index into `s` where `s` holds the
string, and otherwise the title itself as a plain string, so `s` never grows for `qr`.

Since 2026-10-03 (brief QN1, on the owner's ruling of 2026-10-03: "I want numerals on classic
quests too") three more `quest_template` columns are read, `PrevQuestId`, `NextQuestId` and
`NextQuestInChain`, the chain links, ids only. Where two or more quests of one chain share a
title, each ships its position in the chain and the chain's length in `qc`, so the addon can say
"Taming the Beast (II)". Same titled quests the links do not join get nothing (see quest_chains).

Since 2026-09-29 (brief W15, owner QA of 2026-09-29: "Quest: Deviate Hides (1486)" showed no
giver) every creature `creature_questrelation` or `creature_involvedrelation` names for a titled
quest ships as a name of its own, even where it drops, sells and trains nothing: its name in
`s`, its kind in `ck`, its display id in `cd`, its `SubName` in `st` and its quest lists in `qg`
(its pins and side in the caller's EraPlaces.lua), read by exactly the rules those columns follow.
Brief N3 had shipped a giver only where another row already named it. Nothing new is read, and a
creature with no quest link is untouched. Gameobject givers are not read (the objects this
module reads are loot sources only). So that a list record's two digit name field still fits
once `s` passes 8,280 strings, such an `s` is two sorted runs: the names the lists carry, then
the rest. A table that fits stays one sorted run.

Since brief P6a three more tables are read, for the trainers: `npc_trainer` (a creature id and a
spell id per row), `npc_trainer_template` (a template id and a spell id per row, joined to a
creature through `creature_template.TrainerTemplateId`) and, from `spell_template`, the id, the
three `Effect` columns and the three `EffectTriggerSpell` columns and nothing else, to turn a
trainer's "learn" spell into the spell it teaches. Ids only: no spell name, no description, no
cost, no required level or skill. A taught spell is kept only where the caller's selection keeps
it (BuildFacts.profession_spells: ItemTree keeps the spells THIS build's own `SkillLineAbility`
files under a profession or secondary skill line, the coordinator's decision on brief P6a: its
trainer rows are about recipes, a class trainer teaches no item, and the class trainers' 27,038
pairs would have taken the file past the then 1.6 MB), and the list ships per trainer NAME in
`tr`, so a trainer's page can say what it teaches and a spell's sources can name its trainers. A
trainer is a creature the table lists, so it gets its portrait and title through the same paths a
vendor does.

The map pins and paths are read out of the dump here (the `creature` and `gameobject` positions,
the waypoints) and placed on a client build's own zone maps by the caller alone: since brief GA1
they ship in ItemTree's EraPlaces.lua, and since brief EK1 they are made in its own unmirrored
modules (era_places, era_pins). No coordinate of any kind is in this module's file.

Two inputs are pinned, fetched into the gitignored cache, verified by size and sha256 every
run, and never committed:

  * the cmangos dump, for every fact above but the zones, the spawn positions among them;
  * two files of pfQuest's vanilla database, read for the **area id** a creature or an object
    spawns in (the objects file, like the units file, per spawn since 2026-09-27). The cmangos
    spawn tables carry a map and a coordinate and no area at all, and
    turning a coordinate into an area needs terrain data this pipeline does not extract. Its
    own coordinates, which are already a zone percentage, are read for two things and no more:
    to tell which spawn of a creature a cmangos row is, so that spawn's area id can be taken,
    and to CHECK the pipeline's own arithmetic. No pfQuest coordinate is shipped.

Brief EK1 (owner ruling of 2026-10-09: the public mirror holds CMaNGOS logic only). `derive` takes
the CMaNGOS half of the input (`cmangos_only`) and a `BuildFacts` (build_facts.py) of plain
selections the caller worked out from its own data, and reads nothing else of a client build: no
client table, no curated file, nothing of the caller's is read or named here. Where a selection
still chooses this file's rows (the residual R1 to R7 of ItemTree-Data's docs/licensing.md), the
choosing is the caller's and this module is handed the answer: the items that ship, the areas a
row may carry, the instance a creature or an object stands inside (no database states an area for
one, and the caller's answer is its build's own `Map` rather than a guess at an entrance), the
category a chest's lock gives, the display ids and the trainer spells a name may carry, and the
quest rows to leave out. Where the caller's own zone names sit in the sorted `s` (their places are
shipped blank) is handed over as numbers too, ranks among the dump's own strings (dump_strings,
BuildFacts.area_ranks and area_ties): this module never holds one of those names.

What is refused: every row for an id the caller's `items` does not hold, unless it names it as
withheld (below); a quest only drop, which the source marks with a negative chance; a chance that
is zero, negative, above 100 or rounds below 0.1; a reference loot loop; a creature or object
whose name is scaffolding rather than content; a container whose own item id `items` does not
hold; and a quest row the caller leaves out because it states it first hand.

Withheld ids, since 2026-09-26. BuildFacts.withheld names ids the build hides (an `Item` row and
no `ItemSparse` row) that an earlier build named, which the caller ships beside this table with
their earlier details. Their rows are emitted exactly as a named item's are. The addon hides them
until the player's own client can name the item or a setting says to show them. A hidden id NOT
in the set, one no build has ever named, is still refused.

See docs/era-sources.md, which is the record shape's contract and is what the addon half is
briefed from. The whole feature is this module, its `compile` stage, the switch that turns it
off, and the one generated file.

# item rows' own (ItemTree-Data docs/data-format.md, brief OPT5), with one more separator between
# rows and one record kind for m:
#
#   module   r = { [itemId] = "<rows>" } beside legend = { {field, type[, sub legend]}, ... } and
#            packed = 1 at the top level of the module, so walking r still meets item ids only.

#            empty slot and trailing empty slots are not written. A number is its shortest exact
#            form (an int as written, a float as Python's repr), a boolean 1 or 0, a string its

#            28), absent fields empty, trailing ones not written. A record field is a number, a
#            boolean or a non empty string.
